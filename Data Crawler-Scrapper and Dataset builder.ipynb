    "# Pairwise analysis of movie Genres\n",
    "As our dataset is multi label, simply looking at the distribution of genres is not sufficient. It might be beneficial to see which genres co-occur, as it might shed some light on inherent biases in our dataset. For example, it would make sense if romance and comedy occur together more often than documentary and comedy. Such inherent biases tell us that the underlying population we are sampling from itself is skewed and not balanced. We may then take steps to account for such problems. Even if we don't take such steps, it is important to be aware that we are making the assumption that an unbalanced dataset is not hurting our performance and if need be, we can come back to address this assumption. Good old scientific method, eh?\n",
    "So for the top 1000 movies let's do some pairwise analysis for genre distributions. Our main purpose is to see which genres occur together in the same movie. So, we first define a function which takes a list and makes all possible pairs from it. Then, we pull the list of genres for a movie and run this function on the list of genres to get all pairs of genres which occur together."

Jake comes to this small western town to dig up the past and to dig up the money-he digs too deep. As he uncovers the circumstances of his father's death, Jake enlists the help of the daughter of a man his father killed, and fends off the town's brutal sheriff. But Jake isn't the only one looking to haul away the money. Escaped from prison, and on the run, Jake's father's surviving partner in crime shows up in town to finally collect his ill-gotten gains. The sheriff, the outlaw, the locals and the girl go straight to what they know-the gun-and Jake, caught in the crossfire, must decide who's side he is on.\",\n",

With his navigation equipment and radio disabled, the man sails unknowingly into the path of a violent storm. Despite his success in patching the breached hull, his mariner's intuition and a strength that belies his age, the man barely survives the tempest. Using only a sextant and nautical maps to chart his progress, he is forced to rely on ocean currents to carry him into a shipping lane in hopes of hailing a passing vessel. But with the sun unrelenting, sharks circling and his meager supplies dwindling, the ever-resourceful sailor soon finds himself staring his mortality in the face.\",\n",

On July 4, 2009 a deadly menace swept through the quaint seaside town of Claridge, Maryland, but the harrowing story of what happened that Independence Day has never been told\\u2014until now. The authorities believed they had buried the truth about the tragedy that claimed over 700 human lives. Now, three years later, a reporter has emerged with footage revealing the cover-up and an unimaginable killer: a mysterious parasitic outbreak. Told from the perspective of those who were there and saw what happened, The Bay unfolds over 24 hours through people's iPhones, Androids, 911 calls, webcams, and whatever else could be used to document the nightmare in Claridge. What follows is a nerve-shredding tale of a small town plunged into absolute terror.\",\n",

Called to the scene of a robbery at a local cinema, Dixon finds himself face-to-face with Riley, a desperate youth armed with a revolver. Dixon initially tries to talk Riley into surrendering the weapon, but Riley panics and fires. Dixon walks to his own death almost uncomprehending. Dixon is taken to hospital, but dies some hours later. The ending is another Ealing quirk, with ordinary decent society, including \\'professional\\' criminals used to violence, banding together to track down and catch the murderer, who is trapped in the crowd at White City greyhound track in west London. To Andy Mitchell falls the honour of arresting Riley.',\n",

    "The basic idea of this representation in this context is that we can think of all the distinct words that are possible in the movies' reviews as a distinct object. And then every movie overview can be thought as a \"Bag\" containing a bunch of these possible objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the case of Spectre the movie above - The \"Bag\" contains the words (\"Cryptic\", \"message\", \"Bond’s\", \"sinister\", \"organization\" ...... \"secret\"....\"the\"). We make such lists for all movie overviews. Finally, we binarize again like we did above for Y. \n",
